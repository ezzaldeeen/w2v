# w2v

Trying to understand how the meaning can be represented numerically,
so i decided to start with **Word2Vec** algorithm.

Building the model in multiple phases:

1. [basic.ipynb]("basic.ipynb"): Basic implementaiton for Word2Vec algorithm,
   in this notebook there's a simple implementation for encoding the corpus,
   preparing the data for training, forward pass, and backward pass. The objective behind
   *basic.ipynb* implementaion is for setting a starting point.
